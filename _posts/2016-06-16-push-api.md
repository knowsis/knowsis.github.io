## Push API

We're introducing our [push API](/websockets) which runs on the same websockets infrastructure that powers our own platform so you can now receive notification of data updates in realtime without having to continually make requests back to our REST API. It also has the added advantage of being supported natively by all of the latest major browsers so you can use it directly on the client side without the need for server side integrations.

Initially the Push API is limited in functionality but we will add to this over the coming months to support more options. We're offering push notifications for [datapoint](/websockets/#anomalyalerttriggered) (sentiment/volume) changes, new [content](/websockets/#topcontent) and [anomaly alerts](/websockets/#anomalyalerttriggered).

## HTML Widgets

If you want to minimise the amount of integration effort we also offer a set of HTML components that can be served inside of an iframe within your existing platform or web site.

The widgets we are making available initially are tweet streams, top content and alerts.

### Tweet Stream

Display a filterable list of tweets per asset or for a selection of assets.

### Top Content

Display a list of the latest news/blogs ordered by share counts

### Alerts

Display the content of our anomaly & M&A alerts.
