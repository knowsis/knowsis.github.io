The asset sentiment endpoint will return a list of sentiment objects. The default view is the current dayâ€™s sentiment data for a single asset based on the specified {identifier} value. The date which the data refers to is also returned in the request

```
GET /assets/{identifier}/sentiment/
```

For API consumers that have licensed our historical sentiment data there are optional parameters to get sentiment for a specified date range

<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Format</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>startdate</td><td>date - (YYYYMMDD)</td><td>the first day in the requested range</td></tr>
    <tr><td>enddate</td><td>date - (YYYYMMDD)</td><td>the last day in the requested range</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The asset sentiment endpoint will adhere to the following behaviour:

1. If no start date or end date is provided the data will be for the current day only.
2. If there is no start date, the data will be returned for the end date only.
3. If there is no end date, the data range will span from the start date provided up until the current day.
4. If the start date is after the end date, the start date will be ignored and the API will adhere to the step 3.

## Sentiment & Volume Values

We are able to deliver different sentiment and volume values depending on the account set up. Speak to your API account manager to discuss the best option for your use case.

### Simple Sentiment

We can provide sentiment as a simple range of values (Very Negative, Negative, Neutral, Postive and Very Postive). This is delivered as an integer value from 0-4 respectively.

### Simple Volume

We can provide volume as a simple range of values (Very Low, Low, Normal, high and Very High). This is delivered as an integer value from 0-4 respectively.


### Normalised Volume

We are also able to return the current daily volume as a value that has been normalised in comparison to a historic window of volume. This is a decimal value ranging from 0 upwards. 

A value of 0.25 is a quarter of the expected daily volume for this particular asset.
A value of 1.0 is equivalent ot the expected value for this particular asset. 
A value of 2.0 is twice the expected value for this particular asset. 

### Raw Counts

We can also provide raw tweet counts, which are the absolute counts of positive, negative and neutral tweets.
